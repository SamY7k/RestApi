Tendulkar had not scored a century in that series by then but in the final Test, he showed his class to help India reach a score from where the match could not be lost. Eventually, India won the game comfortably by a margin of 172 runs."

It came in the first Test match hosted in India following the November 2008 terror attacks in his home city of Mumbai and the century helped India successfully chase down the 2nd highest target in their history. England set a target of 387 runs to chase and it all came to Sachin on the last day. He was patient and calculating throughout the duration of the innings and seemed determined to see India home to a famous win. Tendulkar hit only 9 boundaries in his century but he also took lots of singles and in the company of Yuvraj Singh (85 not out), the master helped India record one of its most famous wins in recent memory."

And the year 2009 was not off to a great start for Sachin Tendulkar. In the 2nd ODI he took his time early on and then counter-attacked to put the Kiwi bowlers under pressure. The way he batted was a treat to watch. He forged a 148-run partnership with Yuvraj Singh for the third wicket and then 135-run partnership for the fourth wicket with skipper MS Dhoni. Both Dhoni (68) and Yuvraj (87) complemented Tendulkar very well. India’s premier batsman had the chance of becoming the first batsman to hit an ODI double hundred. But his cramping body gave up in the 45th over and Tendulkar had to retire on 163. The standout part of this innings was he never let the momentum shift even when he lost partners at the other end."

India got round to posting a massive first innings score of 520 and it was Sachin Tendulkar's superb 160 that was the innings around which that huge total was made. It was an innings of outstanding technical brilliance and scintillating stroke play that made it possible for India to score at 3.4 runs an over. In total Tendulkar hit 26 boundaries and recorded a strike rate of 61.53, as other batsmen as well as tail-ender Zaheer Khan (51) joined in the action to lift the score to 520.

And this innings was exactly one such. He kept up with the required rate and he never seemed to be in any sort of pressure throughout the chase. He counter-attacked but never took any undue risks and played conventional cricket shots and put the Australian bowlers under pressure. Playing some incredible shots he got India perilously close and was extremely disappointed at falling short by three runs. One of his best one day hundreds. They fell short by 3 runs as Tendulkar and the whole of India were left heart-broken. He scored a gritty 175 but India’s lower order just failed to pull off the victory and fell short of just 3 runs."

Along with opener Gautam Gambhir, he put together a superb partnership and hit 11 boundaries in his 211 deliveries vigil at the crease. He completely mastered Muralitharan on a last day pitch and by the time he got his century, Tendulkar had dominated the rest of the Sri Lankan attack as well."

He came in to bat with the scoreboard reading 79 for 2 and played an innings filled with brilliant strokes as he kept losing partners from the other end. The thing with truly brilliant batsmen is that they can raise their game and go for their strokes when they realise that they might be running out of partners. He struck at a rate of 63.25 and hit 11 boundaries in addition to 2 sixes, to play an innings that eventually proved to be decisive in the Test.

He faced only 182 deliveries to score 143 and hit 13 boundaries and six to emerge as the top scorer in the innings.

With defeat looming large, India played poorly yet again, but Sachin Tendulkar played a superb inning to delay the inevitable for as long as he possibly could. Tendulkar walked in to bat with India reeling at 24 for 2 but he did not curb his natural instincts and decided to take on the bowling attack comprising Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Wayne Parnell.

Tendulkar reached the mark off only 140 deliveries, hitting 25 fours – the most by a batsman in a single innings – and three sixes along the way, before reaching his double century with a single off Charl Langeveldt in the final over.

He played all the strokes in the book and scored briskly (strike rate 58.50) as the Sri Lankan bowlers finally wilted under the onslaught.
